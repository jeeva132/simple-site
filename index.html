            <p>
              The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on Friday took the
              first step towards a possible robotic soft landing on the surface
              of the moon on August 23 with the near perfect launch of the
              Chandrayaan 3 spacecraft into an orbit around the earth by the
              heavy lift LVM3 rocket from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at
              Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh. The LVM3 rocket, carrying a payload
              of 3,895 kg, including the spacecraft, lifted off precisely at
              14:35:17 hours and followed a trajectory that was more or less in
              line with the scheduled stages in the launch of the Chandrayaan-3.

        <h3>Latest news of chandrayan 3</h3>
        <p>
          The spacecraft were not designed to survive the lunar night
          temperatures – which near the south pole can dip below -200° C. But
          ISRO, in a bid to extend the rover and lander’s lifespan, decided to
          shut down all instruments on September 2, a little before sunset, and
          put them in “sleep mode.” The hope was that with the batteries fully
          charged, the instruments could be kept warm enough to survive the
          frigidity. ISRO’s tweet hinted that the rover and lander may not be
          revived. “Hoping for a successful awakening for another set of
          assignments! Else, [the rover and lander] will forever stay there as
          India’s lunar ambassador.” The space agency’s attempts to awaken the
          spacecraft on September 22, when the region received sunlight, were
          unsuccessful. The efforts will continue until September 30, when night
          will fall again.
